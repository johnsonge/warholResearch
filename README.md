Sorting and categorizing data from Warhol's flower images

The purpose of this project is to take a folder of Warhol's flower pictures and be able to find which colors are most prevalent, and why.

Running in Python 2.7

sudo apt-get install python-dev
pip install PIL
pip install pandas

(other dependencies likely required. Will research and fill in soon)

(This step is only if there have been changes made to the Warhol flower set and Workbook)
First run readColor.py, this is what searches through the flowers album and determines their color 


(Main Menu)
run menu.py to get to a menu where the info will be available to you
if you are getting error messages, revisit the required components and make sure you have them all installed.

The easiest way to run is to select menu.py and run from the Idle 2.7 IDE


if you’re running from the command line, navigate to the folder the project is located in by changing directories with ‘cd’ then run the file:

example:
cd dropbox/warholProject
python menu.py
